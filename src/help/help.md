**smiscvm - Stupid Mixed Instruction Set Computer Virtual Machine**

Simulates the execution of "SMISC" binaries.

**Options:**
* Arguments that are not flags and do not belong to any will be treated as input files.
* `--hertz` sets the target speed of the simulation in clock cycles per second.
* `--legacy-encoding` makes the machine decode the standard output with ASCII instead of STC
* `-h` or `-help` prints this screen or other help screens if accompanied by the flags listed above.
